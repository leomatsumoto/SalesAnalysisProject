The task in hand, based on the business demand we got is:
- make the internet sales report into a interactive dashboard
	- specs: 
		- amount and type of product sold
		- to whom (clients)
		- when (date)
		- who sold it (sales person)
			- nees to be able to filter the salesman
		- compare the numbers to a budget they have (sent on xlxs)
		- look 2 years back (budget from 2023) when doing sales analysis


The first step we will take, is to have the date data cleaned, so we can manipulate it to build the dashboard further in the future. 

	In order to do that, we need to make a query selecting the relevant info from dbo.DimDate
	DimDate was converted into a csv file

Custumer data 
	- left join dimcustumer and geograpgykey so we can use geodata later. The geodata in c.dimcustumer is just a PK
	- on gender, CASE wase used to convert M and F into Male and Female
	- FullName was made concatenating c.firstname and c.lastname

---- Product
	- left join with category and subcategory
